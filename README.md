The best way to code is in chunks or modules. Modules allow you to test pieces of software, isolate problems, and implement new ideas. The CRUDE python file used to enable the dashboard's access to the database is a prime example of this. Not all the methods within that file were there at the inception of ProjectTwo, but were allowed to be added after the fact. I approached the development of the dashboard in the same way I had in previous courses. I would look at what needs to be created/implemented and try to have it mesh together with any other files required for the finished product. For this project I was using a remote access VM (virtual machine), this was different for me because I prefer to use my own PC as the developmental environment, but I was unable to easily transfer the databases on to my PC for testing. Computer scientists work to create shortcuts which make work less tedious. This database-interface, for example, allows users to point and click on the information they want to retrieve from the database; rather than accessing the database directly and having to learn the commands needed to run the retrieval of the same data. A computer scientist's job is to make the execution of work faster, more efficient, and easier whenever and wherever possible.
